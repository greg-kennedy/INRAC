# INRAC
Perl module for working with INRAC
Greg Kennedy, 2018

## What?
INRAC is a language used for creating "chat bots" (text parse and response).  It is most known for being the language that powered RACTER, the famous chat program from the early 1980s.

Information on the language is difficult to find.  This module, and the accompanying documentation, is an attempt at reverse-engineering the INRAC language.
